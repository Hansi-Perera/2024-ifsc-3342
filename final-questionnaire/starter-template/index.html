  <h1>Site Planning Questionnaire</h1>

  <h2>Who is the target audience?</h2>
  <p> My target audience will be Sri Lankan natives as  well as tourists and possible donors.</p>

  <h2>How can I tailor the website to reach that audience?</h2>
  <p>I can pay attention to the theme and keep it similar while making it more professional 
  with better accessibility for a range of devices. I also will attempt to structure it better
  instead of the given cheap/ free template started website that exists. 
  </p>

  <h2>What are the goals for the site?</h2>
  <p> The site is dedicated to wildlife conservation and sustainable development.
    The site educates people on different projects that support their main goal and 
    gives an opportunity for people to donate. 
  </p>

  <h2>How will I gather the information?</h2>
  <p>Mostly from the created website. I plan to add a few extra things and  change the layout somewhat. </p>

  <h2>What are my sources for multimedia content?</h2>
  <p>There are pictures and videos on the website. </p>

  <h2>What is my budget?</h2>
  <p> Pretty much nothing, I am just working to recreate this website with responsiveness. </p>

  <h2>How long do I have to complete the project?</h2>
  <p>A few weeks </p>

  <h2>Who is on my project team?</h2>
  <p>Myself at firrt but I will be taking advice from peers, teachers and family.  </p>

  <h2>How often should the site be updated?</h2>
  <p> Every few weeks. </p>

  <h2>Who is responsible for updating the site?</h2>
  <p> Since it is a government site, technically it would be their government as new projects come
    and information on the population and wildlife changes.
